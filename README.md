## What is ReactOS?
ReactOS is a Free and Open Source operating system based on the Windows architecture, 
providing support for existing applications and drivers, and an alternative to the current dominant consumer operating system.

The code of ReactOS is licensed under [GNU GPL 2.0+](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0+.html).

It is not another wrapper built on Linux, like WINE. It does not attempt or plan to compete with WINE; in fact, the user-mode part of ReactOS is almost entirely WINE-based and our two teams have cooperated closely in the past. ReactOS is also not "yet another OS". It does not attempt to be a third player, like SkyOS or any other alternative OS out there. People are not meant to uninstall Linux and use ReactOS instead; ReactOS is a replacement for Windows users who want a Windows replacement that behaves just like Windows.

## Building ReactOS

compatibility, is always keeping an eye toward compatibility with
