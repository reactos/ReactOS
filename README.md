## What is ReactOS?

ReactOS™ is an Open Source effort to develop a quality operating system that is
compatible with applications and drivers written for the Microsoft® Windows™ NT
family of operating systems (NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, Seven).

The ReactOS project, although currently focused on Windows Server 2003
compatibility, is always keeping an eye toward compatibility with
Windows Vista and future Windows NT releases.

The code of ReactOS is licensed under [GNU GPL 2.0+](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0+.html).

## Building

To build the system it is strongly advised to use the _ReactOS Build Environment
(RosBE)._ Up-to-date versions for Windows and for Unix/GNU-Linux are available
from our download page at: http://www.reactos.org/wiki/Build_Environment/

Alternatively one can use Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) version 2010+. Building with MSVC is covered here: https://www.reactos.org/wiki/Building_with_MSVC

### Binaries

To build ReactOS you must use run `configure` script in the directory you want to have builds. Choose `configure.cmd` or `configure.sh` depending on your system. Then run `ninja <modulename>` to build a module you want or just `ninja` to build all modules.

### Bootable images

To build a bootable CD image run `ninja bootcd` from the
build directory. This will create a CD image with a filename `bootcd.iso`.

See ["Building ReactOS"](http://www.reactos.org/wiki/Building_ReactOS) for more details.

## Installing

ReactOS can only be installed on a machine that has a FAT16 or FAT32 partition
as the active (bootable) partition. The partition on which ReactOS is to be
installed (which may or may not be the bootable partition) must also be
formatted as FAT16 or FAT32. ReactOS Setup can format the partitions if
needed.

To install ReactOS from the bootable CD distribution, extract the archive
contents. Then burn the CD image, boot from it, and follow instructions.

See ["Installing ReactOS"](https://www.reactos.org/wiki/Installing_ReactOS) Wiki page or [INSTALL](INSTALL) for more details.

## Testing

If you discover a bug in ReactOS search on JIRA first - it might be reported already. If not report the bug providing logs and as many information as possible. 

See ["File Bugs"](https://www.reactos.org/wiki/File_Bugs) for a guide.

__NOTE:__ The bug tracker is _not_ for discussions. Please use `#reactos` Freenode IRC channel or our [forum](https://reactos.org/forum).

## More information

ReactOS is a Free and Open Source operating system based on the Windows architecture, 
providing support for existing applications and drivers, and an alternative to the current dominant consumer operating system.

It is not another wrapper built on Linux, like WINE. It does not attempt or plan to compete with WINE; in fact, the user-mode part of ReactOS is almost entirely WINE-based and our two teams have cooperated closely in the past. 

ReactOS is also not "yet another OS". It does not attempt to be a third player like any other alternative OS out there. People are not meant to uninstall Linux and use ReactOS instead; ReactOS is a replacement for Windows users who want a Windows replacement that behaves just like Windows.

More information is available at: https://www.reactos.org.

## Who is responsible

Active devs are listed as members of [GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/reactos/people). 
Also see the [CREDITS](CREDITS) file for others.

## Code mirrors

The main development is done on [GitHub](https://github.com/reactos/reactos). We have an [alternative mirror](https://git.reactos.org/) it case GitHub is down. 

There is also an obsolete [SVN archive repository](https://svn.reactos.org/svn/reactos?view=revision) that is kept for historical purposes.
